# Vector-Space-Model
In this project of Information Retrieval, a model called Vector Space Model is implemented which is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers (such as index terms).There is a collection of 30 documents on which first preprocessing is applied in terms of tokenization, case folding, stop-words removal and stemming. Also there are several routines for query parsing, and to fetch the required list of documents by using alpha=0.05.It is implemented in jupyter notebook with GUI
